# Fraction Calculator

A calculator with a twist, it calculates fractions.  Data entry needs to be in the following format:

NUMBER <Operator> NUMBER

Operators supported: + - * /

Numbers need to be entered in this format:  25_3/5

Where the whole number is separated from any fraction using the underscore character.

An example of a whole formula: 
2_3/4 * 4/5
